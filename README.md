Facebook GDPR Timeline in criminal investigation: A small processing and vizualisation of Facebook-GDPR Database


  Put the file `facebook_script.py` in the folder where you store your _Facebook Download Data_ folder (see [my article](https://clairebilat.github.io/forensic-data-stories/2021-01-07-facebook-rgpd/) for details on how to download this folder, and open this destination in a terminal. Make sur you have `python` and `pip` installed and that they are in the PATH environment variable. Then run the command `pip install pandas datetime plotly`. Lastly, you will just have to run the command `python ./facebook_script.py %folder_name%`, replacing _%folder_name%_ by the name of the Facebook download data folder you want to analyze. The results will be stored in a newly created folder _%folder_name%\_results_.
